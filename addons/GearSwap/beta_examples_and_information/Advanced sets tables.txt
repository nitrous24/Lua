============== Advanced "sets" tables ==============

-- Augments --
Augments are currently "in," but there are a lot of different augments and SE's system for
handling them is basically hardcoded to item ID, so don't expect it to be perfect. The system
will use the first item it finds in your inventory that matches the name/augment combination that
you provide. If you provide an ambiguous set of conditions, the resulting equipped item will be
ambiguous (could vary).


In order to specify an item by augment, you must use the full name of the augment (even if the
augment appears on your item in a contracted form) and set it up like this:
    sets.aftercast_Idle = {ring1={name="Dark Ring",augments={"Physical Damage Taken -6%"}},
	    ring2={name="Dark Ring",augments={"Breath Damage Taken -6%","Physical Damage Taken -5%"}}}

		
If it pleases you, you can store your augmented items in variables:
    lefty = {name="Dark Ring",augments={"Physical Damage Taken -6%"}}
	righty = {name="Dark Ring",augments={"Breath Damage Taken -6%","Physical Damage Taken -5%"}}
	sets.aftercast_Idle = {ring1=lefty,ring2=righty}

This will save you a little work when you are dealing with using the same augmented item in multiple sets.



-- Ordering your table --
Currently tables can be ordered by using advanced "sets" tables similar to the above:
    sets.nohead = {head={name="empty",order=2},lring={name="Angha ring",order=1}}

This will cause Angha Ring to equip first, and then will take off the equipped head armor. It
reverses the with whatever item was previously stored in that spot. Order is a number from 1 to 16, and
the initial order is always:
1) Main
2) Sub
3) Range
4) Ammo
5) Head
6) Body
7) Hands
8) Legs
9) Feet
10) Neck
11) Waist
12) Ear 1
13) Ear 2
14) Ring 1
15) Ring 2
16) Back

I do not recommend moving Sub in front of Main, Ammo in front of Range, etc. as these will cause equip
failures.
